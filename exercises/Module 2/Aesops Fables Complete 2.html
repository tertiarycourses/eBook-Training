all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you
will be broken as easily as these sticks.&quot;</span></p>

the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog

After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only
discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice

he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf.
Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said:
&quot;Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if
I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the
thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I

and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two started together.
The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady
pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare, lying down by the wayside,
fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the
Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</span></p>

her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take
her aloft and float her in the air. &quot;I will give you,&quot; she said,
&quot;all the riches of the Red Sea.&quot; &quot;I will teach you to fly
then,&quot; said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her
almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain,
dashing her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death:
&quot;I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and
clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?&quot;</span></p>

Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired

indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond
measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst,
thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the
difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.
&quot;If,&quot; said he, &quot;you will place your forefeet upon the wall and
bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out
afterwards.&quot; The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.
Steadying himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the
well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking
his promise, he turned around and cried out, &quot;You foolish old fellow! If

he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could.
The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he
was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly
inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. &quot;He

who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home
some tidbit to eat. The Donkey, on the contrary, had much work to do in
grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the
farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and
idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and
galloped into his master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and
frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his
master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the
dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon
his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of
their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Donkey to his stable with
kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Donkey, as he returned to his stall beaten

made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present themselves before
him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king. The
Jackdaw, knowing his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and
collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his companions, and
stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping thereby to make himself the most
beautiful of all. When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled
before Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered
finery. But when Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his
plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucked from him his own
feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the
night. The next day it snowed very hard, so that he could not take the herd to
their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his
own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the strangers more
abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his
own. When the thaw set in, he led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats
scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd scolded
them for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he had taken
more care of them than of his own herd. One of them, turning about, said to
him: &quot;That is the very reason why we are so cautious; for if you yesterday
treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if
others came after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to
ourselves.&quot;</span></p>

might give notice of his presence wherever he went. Thinking it a mark of
distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the
marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: &quot;Why do you make such an
exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not, believe me, any order
of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men to
avoid you as an ill mannered dog.&quot;</span></p>

they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid
of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. One of them
interrupting him said, &quot;If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend,

promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I
continued blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed. I
on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my

to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of
effecting my escape.&quot; At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to
feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the farm-bailiff with
several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him. The Stag,
congratulating himself on his safety, began to express his sincere thanks to
the Oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of need. One of them again
answered him: &quot;We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not over. There
is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes,
and until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril.&quot; At that
moment the master himself entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had
not been properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: &quot;Why is
there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie
on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.&quot; While he
thus examined everything in turn, he spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag
peeping out of the straw. Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag
should be seized and killed.</span></p>

of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most renowned for
their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for
their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle
array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was
done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by
challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their heads with
straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had
the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as

account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the

wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our families as food for

down to the cave of the Sow, and said, &quot;Your children are in great danger;
for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared
to pounce upon one of your little pigs.&quot; Having instilled these fears into

night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and
her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day.
Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and
the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus

yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. The Innkeeper,

painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful

returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing him on account of his

neither.</span></p>

in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own
opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore
man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass
wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life was reserved for the Dog,

ordered at the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his

be brought before him, and greeted them with this salutation: &quot;What sort

replied, &quot;You seem to me a most mighty king.&quot; &quot;And what is your
estimate of those you see around me?&quot; &quot;These,&quot; he made answer,
&quot;are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and
leaders of armies.&quot; The Ape and all his court, gratified with the lie,
commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. On this the
truthful Traveler thought to himself, &quot;If so great a reward be given for a

the truth?&quot; The Ape quickly turned to him. &quot;And pray how do I and these
my friends around me seem to you?&quot; &quot;Thou art,&quot; he said, &quot;a

destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the Shepherd returned to find his
flock destroyed, he exclaimed: &quot;I have been rightly served; why did I

move for safety. &quot;There is no occasion to move yet, my son,&quot; she
replied; &quot;the man who only sends to his friends to help him with his

days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness. He
said, &quot;I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many
reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.&quot; The Lark on hearing
these words said to her brood, &quot;It is time now to be off, my little ones,

reap the field himself.&quot;</span></p>

being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with all. He first
blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the horns of the bull below

Jupiter, because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone
might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the

not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants

inability to avenge them. A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the
Eagle. While hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a
goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a
burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a

spring upon him. The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his utmost
speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe
distance from the Lion. But entering a wood he became entangled by his horns,
and the Lion quickly came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus
reproached himself: &quot;Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet
which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these antlers which have
proved my destruction.&quot;</span></p>

and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who
invented a new amusement for the occasion. Various public performers contended
for the prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his
jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been
brought out on any stage before. This report being spread about made a great
stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. The Buffoon appeared alone
upon the platform, without any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of
expectation caused an intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his
bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice
that the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded that
it should be shaken out. When that was done and nothing was found, they cheered
the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd,
observing all that has passed, said, &quot;So help me, Hercules, he shall not beat
me at that trick!&quot; and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing
on the next day, though in a much more natural way. On the morrow a still
larger crowd assembled in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite
actor very generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the
Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers appeared on the
stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the
preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators. Next the Countryman
commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes
(which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take
hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak. The Crowd, however,
cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far more exact
imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On
this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most
positive proof the greatness of their mistake. &quot;Look here,&quot; he said,
&quot;this shows what sort of judges you are.&quot;</span></p>

picture of a lion. When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus
confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: &quot;O you
most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in
his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl:
what shall I now do to you?&quot; With these words he stretched out his hands
toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might
beat the lion. But one of the tree's prickles pierced his finger and caused
great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting

with his son, they tied the legs of the Donkey together and with the help of a
pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance

it, till the Donkey, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was
subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell
into the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

stole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon arriving at home they prepared
to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: &quot;Pray spare me; I am very
serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their work.&quot; &quot;That
is the very reason why we must the more kill you,&quot; they replied; &quot;for
when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger
Dog, a friend of his, saying, &quot;My master gives a feast, and there is
always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.&quot; The Dog thus
invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations for so grand an
entertainment, said in the joy of his heart, &quot;How glad I am that I came! I
do not often get such a chance as this. I will take care and eat enough to last
me both today and tomorrow.&quot; While he was congratulating himself and
wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving
about among his dishes and, seizing him by his fore and hind paws, bundled him
without ceremony out of the window. He fell with force upon the ground and
limped away, howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs,
who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper. He replied,
&quot;Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much wine that I remember nothing.
I do not know how I got out of the house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

down at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree. As they rested
under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, &quot;What a
singularly useless tree is the Plane! It bears no fruit, and is not of the
least service to man.&quot; The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, &quot;You
ungrateful fellows! Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under
my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined to put
an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty precipice into
a deep lake below. As they scampered off in large numbers to carry out their
resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their feet
and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On seeing the rapid
disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares cried out to his companions:
&quot;Stay, my friends, do not do as you intended; for you now see that there
are creatures who are still more timid than ourselves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

O Jupiter!&quot; he said, &quot;that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in
shape, and powerful in attack. I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet
furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest, and what
a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the
crowing of a cock.&quot; Jupiter replied, &quot;Why do you blame me without a
cause? I have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and your
courage never fails you except in this one instance.&quot; On hearing this the
Lion groaned and lamented very much and, reproaching himself with his
cowardice, wished that he might die. As these thoughts passed through his mind,
he met an Elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him. After a time
he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he inquired what
was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then.
Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied,
&quot;Do you see that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is
sealed. I should die presently.&quot; The Lion said, &quot;Well, since so huge
a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself
dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.&quot;</span></p>

smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away. The Tanner put off
his departure from time to time, saying that he would leave soon. But as he
still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the
smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints.</span></p>

buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and looking upon the Sea,
loaded it with reproaches. He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of
its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and
destroyed them. The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him:
&quot;Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own nature as
calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create
these waves, and lash me into fury.&quot;</span></p>

filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain. The Mule carrying the
treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value of his burden,
and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to his neck. His
companion followed with quiet and easy step. All of a sudden Robbers rushed
upon them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with their owners,
wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized
while taking no notice of the grain. The Mule which had been robbed and wounded
bewailed his misfortunes. The other replied, &quot;I am indeed glad that I was
thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any
wound.&quot;</span></p>

came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to say,
&quot;I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.&quot; The Shepherd boldly examined
the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it
out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time
after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned
&quot;to be cast to the Lions&quot; as the punishment for his imputed crime.
But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the Shepherd as the
man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his foot
upon his lap. The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be
set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to
his friends.</span></p>

that he himself could obtain the same honors. He went to Jupiter, and besought
him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed at his request because he was not

refused to give him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears.</span></p>

him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while others,
moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt
him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night they returned home, not
dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him
dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed
himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid
steps. After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing
the Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had spared
his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged
only for their lives. To them the Panther made this reply: &quot;I remember
alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave me food aside,
therefore, your fears. I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.&quot;</span></p>

The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield. Then the Donkey, seeing

Eagle was weighed down with grief. Later, another neighbor purchased him and
allowed his feathers to grow again. The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a
hare, brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor. A Fox, seeing this,
exclaimed, &quot;Do not cultivate the favor of this man, but of your former

have done to yourself to add insult to injury?&quot; The Bald Man replied,
&quot;I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was no

in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had

snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it settled upon
its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its

returned the Kite, &quot;I am much stronger than you are.&quot; &quot;Why, are
you able to secure the means of living by your plunder?&quot; &quot;Well, I
have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons.&quot; The Eagle,
persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. Shortly after the nuptials,
the Eagle said, &quot;Fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised
me.&quot; The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest
possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it had lain about the fields.
&quot;Is this,&quot; said the Eagle, &quot;the faithful fulfillment of your
promise to me?&quot; The Kite replied, &quot;That I might attain your royal
hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew that
