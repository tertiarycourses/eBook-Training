			<p class="Body-Text_Body---1st-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span><span class="small-caps">here is a sad want </span>of variety amongst evergreen and deciduous shrubs in the average English garden. Faith is placed in a few shrubs with a reputation for robbing the soil of its goodness and making a monotonous ugly green bank, neither pleasant to look at nor of any protective value. As one who knows shrubs well and the way to group them says, &quot;Even the landscape gardeners, the men who have the making of gardens—with, of course, notable exceptions—do not seem to know the rich storehouse to draw from.&quot; Very true is this. We see evidence of it every day. The mixed shrubbery is fondly clung to as a place for all shrubs, whether flowering or otherwise, and the result is a thicket of growths, a case indeed of a survival of the fittest. There are other shrubs than Privet in this fair world of ours, and as for providing shelter, the wind whistles through its bare stems and creates a draught good for neither man, beast, nor plant. Of the cherry laurel again there is far too much in gardens. Few other plants can stand against its greedy, searching roots, and its vigorous branches and big leaves kill other leaf-growth near them. Grown in the proper way, that is, as an isolated shrub, with abundance of space to develop its graceful branches and brilliant green leaves, the Cherry Laurel is a beautiful evergreen; it is quite happy in shady, half-wooded places. But grown, as it is so often, jammed up and smothering other things, or held in bounds by a merciless and beauty-destroying knife, its presence has not been to the advantage of English g<span class="no-break">ardening. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">When the planting season comes round, think of some of the good shrubs not yet in the garden, and forget pontic Rhododendron, Laurel, Aucuba, and Privet. By this is not meant rare shrubs, such as may only be had from the few nurseries of the very highest rank or from those that make rare shrubs a speciality, but good things that may be grown in any garden and that appear in all good shrub ca<span class="no-break">talogues. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">Perhaps no beautiful and now well-known shrub is more neglected than beautiful <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Exochorda grandiflora</span> (the Pearl Bush). Its near relatives, the Spiræas, are in every shrubbery, but one may go through twenty and not see Exochorda. Even of the Spiræas one does not half often see enough of <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">S. Thunbergi</span>, a perfect milky way of little starry bloom in April and a most shapely little bush, or the double-flowered <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">S. prunifolia</span>, with its long wreaths of flower-like double thorn or minute white roses and its autumn bravery of scarlet foliage. The hardy Magnolias are not given the opportunity they deserve of making our gardens lovely in earliest summer. Who that has seen <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Magnolia stellata</span> in its April dress of profuse white bloom and its summer and autumn dignity of handsome though not large foliage, would endure to be without it? or who would not desire to have the fragrant chalices of <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">M. soulangeana</span>, with their outside staining of purple, and <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">M. conspicua</span>, of purest white in the early months of March and April? And why does not every garden hold one, at least, of the sweet <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Chimonanthus</span>, offering, as it does in February, an abundance of its little blooms of a fragrance so rich and powerful that it can be scarcely matched throughout <span class="no-break">the year? </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body"><span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Cassinia fulvida</span>, still known in nurseries by its older name of Diplopappus, in winter wears its fullest dress of tiny gold-backed leafage in long graceful sprays, that are borne in such profusion that they only beg to be cut to accompany the rare flowers of winter that we bring indoors to sweeten and enliven o<span class="no-break">ur rooms. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">Of small-flowering trees none is lovelier than the Snowy Mespilus (<span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Amelanchier</span>), and for a tree of somewhat larger size the good garden form of the native Bird Cherry is beautiful in the early year. The North American <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Halesia</span> (the Snowdrop Tree) should be in every garden, either as a bush or tree, every branch hung in May with its full array of pendent bloom of the size and general shape of Snowdrops, only of a warm and almost creamy instead of a cold snow-whit<span class="no-break">e colour. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">Few spring-flowering shrubs are more free and graceful than <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Forsythia suspensa</span>, and if it can be planted on a slight eminence and encouraged to throw down its many-feet-long graceful sprays it then exhibits its best garden use. The Chinese <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Viburnum plicatum</span> is another shrub well known but unfairly neglected, flowering with the earliest Irises. Grouped with the grand <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Iris pallida dalmatica</span> it is a thing never to be f<span class="no-break">orgotten. </span></p>

			<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-3">
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="inline-caption">
					<p class="Captions">Calycanthus floridus, with its spice-scented blooms, is a lovely addition in a fine, cool, well-sheltered corner.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body"><span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Æsculus (Pavia) parviflora</span>, blooming in July when flowering shrubs are rare, is easily grown and strikingly handsome, and yet how rarely seen! <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Calycanthus floridus</span>, with its spice-scented blooms of low-toned crimson, also a late summer flower, is a fine thing in a cool, well-sheltered corner, where the sun cannot burn the flowers. The Rose Acacia (<span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Robinia hispida</span>), trained on a wall or house, is as beautiful as any Wistaria, and the quality of the low-toned rosy bloom of a much rarer colour. It is quite hardy, but so brittle that it needs close and careful wall training or other support. To name a few others in the same kind of category, but rather less hardy, the Sweet Bay is the noblest of evergreen bushes or small trees; the Tamarisk, with its grey plumes of foliage and summer flower-plumes of tenderest pink, is a delightful plant in our southern counties, doing especially well near the sea. <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Clethra alnifolia</span>, against a wall or in the open, is a mass of flower in late summer, and the best of the <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Hibiscus syriacus</span>, or <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Althæa frutex</span>, the shrubbery representatives of Mallows and Hollyhocks, are autumn flowers of the best class. A bushy plant of half-woody character that may well be classed among shrubs, and that was beloved of our grandmothers, is <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Leycesteria formosa</span>, a delightful thing in the later autumn. The large-fruited <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Euonymus</span> (Spindle Tree) is another good thing too litt<span class="no-break">le grown. </span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">For a peaty garden there are many delightful plants in the neglected though easy-to-be-had list. One of these is the beautiful and highly fragrant <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Azalea occidentalis</span>, all the better that the flowers and leaves come together and that it is later than the Ghent Azaleas. Then there are the two sweet-scented North American Bog Myrtles, <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Myrica cerifera</span> and <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Comptonia asplenifolia</span>, the charming little <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Leiophyllum buxifolium</span>, of neatest bushy form, and the <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Ledum palustre</span>, whose bruised leaves are of delightful aromatic fragrance; <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Vaccinium pennsylvanicum</span>, pretty in leaf and flower and blazing scarlet in autumn, and <span class="Genus-Plant-Names---In-Copy _idGenCharOverride-1">Gaultheria Shallon</span>, a most important sub-shrub, revelling in moist peat or any cool s<span class="no-break">andy soil.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text_Body">These examples by no means exhaust the list of desirable shrubs that may be found for the slightest seeking. This brief recital of their names and qualities is only meant as a reminder that all these good things are close at hand, while many more are only waiting to be <span class="no-break">asked for.</span></p>
