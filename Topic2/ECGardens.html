<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:18.0pt'>Guide to
English Cottage Gardens</span></b></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Encouraging Variety</span></h1>

<p class=Body-first><span lang=EN-US>There is a sad want of variety amongst
evergreen and deciduous shrubs in the average English garden. Faith is placed
in a few shrubs with a reputation for robbing the soil of its goodness and
making a monotonous ugly green bank, neither pleasant to look at nor of any
protective value. As one who knows shrubs well and the way to group them says,
&quot;Even the landscape gardeners, the men who have the making of
gardens—with, of course, notable exceptions—do not seem to know the rich
storehouse to draw from.&quot; Very true is this. We see evidence of it every
day. The mixed shrubbery is fondly clung to as a place for all shrubs, whether
flowering or otherwise, and the result is a thicket of growths, a case indeed
of a survival of the fittest. There are other shrubs than Privet in this fair
world of ours, and as for providing shelter, the wind whistles through its bare
stems and creates a draught good for neither man, beast, nor plant. Of the
cherry laurel again there is far too much in gardens. Few other plants can
stand against its greedy, searching roots, and its vigorous branches and big
leaves kill other leaf-growth near them. Grown in the proper way, that is, as
an isolated shrub, with abundance of space to develop its graceful branches and
brilliant green leaves, the Cherry Laurel is a beautiful evergreen; it is quite
happy in shady, half-wooded places. But grown, as it is so often, jammed up and
smothering other things, or held in bounds by a merciless and beauty-destroying
knife, its presence has not been to the advantage of English gardening. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>When the planting season comes round, think of
some of the good shrubs not yet in the garden, and forget pontic Rhododendron,
Laurel, Aucuba, and Privet. By this is not meant rare shrubs, such as may only
be had from the few nurseries of the very highest rank or from those that make
rare shrubs a speciality, but good things that may be grown in any garden and
that appear in all good shrub catalogues. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps no beautiful and now well-known shrub is
more neglected than beautiful <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Exochorda
grandiflora</span> (the Pearl Bush). Its near relatives, the Spiræas, are in
every shrubbery, but one may go through twenty and not see Exochorda. Even of
the Spiræas one does not half often see enough of <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>S. Thunbergi</span>, a perfect milky way of little
starry bloom in April and a most shapely little bush, or the double-flowered <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>S. prunifolia</span>, with its long wreaths of
flower-like double thorn or minute white roses and its autumn bravery of
scarlet foliage. The hardy Magnolias are not given the opportunity they deserve
of making our gardens lovely in earliest summer. Who that has seen <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Magnolia stellata</span> in its April dress of
profuse white bloom and its summer and autumn dignity of handsome though not
large foliage, would endure to be without it? or who would not desire to have
the fragrant chalices of <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>M. soulangeana</span>,
with their outside staining of purple, and <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>M.
conspicua</span>, of purest white in the early months of March and April? And
why does not every garden hold one, at least, of the sweet <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Chimonanthus</span>, offering, as it does in February,
an abundance of its little blooms of a fragrance so rich and powerful that it
can be scarcely matched throughout the year? </span></p>

<p class=Body><span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy><span lang=EN-US>Cassinia
fulvida</span></span><span lang=EN-US>, still known in nurseries by its older
name of Diplopappus, in winter wears its fullest dress of tiny gold-backed
leafage in long graceful sprays, that are borne in such profusion that they
only beg to be cut to accompany the rare flowers of winter that we bring
indoors to sweeten and enliven our rooms. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Of small-flowering trees none is lovelier than
the Snowy Mespilus (<span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Amelanchier</span>), and
for a tree of somewhat larger size the good garden form of the native Bird
Cherry is beautiful in the early year. The North American <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Halesia</span> (the Snowdrop Tree) should be in
every garden, either as a bush or tree, every branch hung in May with its full
array of pendent bloom of the size and general shape of Snowdrops, only of a
warm and almost creamy instead of a cold snow-white colour. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Few spring-flowering shrubs are more free and
graceful than <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Forsythia suspensa</span>, and
if it can be planted on a slight eminence and encouraged to throw down its
many-feet-long graceful sprays it then exhibits its best garden use. The
Chinese <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Viburnum plicatum</span> is another
shrub well known but unfairly neglected, flowering with the earliest Irises. Grouped
with the grand <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Iris pallida dalmatica</span>
it is a thing never to be forgotten. </span></p>

<p class=inlineimage><span lang=EN-US><img width=342 height=257 id="Picture 1"
src="ECGardens.fld/image001.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=Captions><span class=s1><span lang=EN-US>Calycanthus floridus, with
its spice-scented blooms, is a lovely addition in a fine, cool, well-sheltered
corner.</span></span></p>

<p class=Body><span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy><span lang=EN-US>Æsculus
(Pavia) parviflora</span></span><span lang=EN-US>, blooming in July when
flowering shrubs are rare, is easily grown and strikingly handsome, and yet how
rarely seen! <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Calycanthus floridus</span>,
with its spice-scented blooms of low-toned crimson, also a late summer flower,
is a fine thing in a cool, well-sheltered corner, where the sun cannot burn the
flowers. The Rose Acacia (<span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Robinia hispida</span>),
trained on a wall or house, is as beautiful as any Wistaria, and the quality of
the low-toned rosy bloom of a much rarer colour. It is quite hardy, but so
brittle that it needs close and careful wall training or other support. To name
a few others in the same kind of category, but rather less hardy, the Sweet Bay
is the noblest of evergreen bushes or small trees; the Tamarisk, with its grey
plumes of foliage and summer flower-plumes of tenderest pink, is a delightful
plant in our southern counties, doing especially well near the sea. <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Clethra alnifolia</span>, against a wall or in the
open, is a mass of flower in late summer, and the best of the <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Hibiscus syriacus</span>, or <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Althæa frutex</span>, the shrubbery
representatives of Mallows and Hollyhocks, are autumn flowers of the best
class. A bushy plant of half-woody character that may well be classed among
shrubs, and that was beloved of our grandmothers, is <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Leycesteria formosa</span>, a delightful thing in
the later autumn. The large-fruited <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Euonymus</span>
(Spindle Tree) is another good thing too little grown. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>For a peaty garden there are many delightful
plants in the neglected though easy-to-be-had list. One of these is the
beautiful and highly fragrant <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Azalea
occidentalis</span>, all the better that the flowers and leaves come together
and that it is later than the Ghent Azaleas. Then there are the two
sweet-scented North American Bog Myrtles, <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Myrica
cerifera</span> and <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Comptonia asplenifolia</span>,
the charming little <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Leiophyllum buxifolium</span>,
of neatest bushy form, and the <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Ledum
palustre</span>, whose bruised leaves are of delightful aromatic fragrance; <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Vaccinium pennsylvanicum</span>, pretty in leaf
and flower and blazing scarlet in autumn, and <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Gaultheria Shallon</span>, a most important
sub-shrub, revelling in moist peat or any cool sandy soil.</span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>These examples by no means exhaust the list of
desirable shrubs that may be found for the slightest seeking. This brief
recital of their names and qualities is only meant as a reminder that all these
good things are close at hand, while many more are only waiting to be asked
for.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Ornamental Planting in Woodland</span></h1>

<p class=Body-first><span lang=EN-US>Where woodland adjoins garden ground, and
the one passes into the other by an almost imperceptible gradation, a desire is
often felt to let the garden influence penetrate some way into the wood by the
planting within the wood of some shrubs or trees of distinctly ornamental
character.</span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Such a desire very naturally arises—it is wild
gardening with the things of larger growth; but, like all forms of wild
gardening (which of all branches of gardening is the most difficult to do
rightly, and needs the greatest amount of knowledge), the wishes of the planter
must be tempered with extreme precaution and restraint. It does not do to plant
in the wild garden things of well-known garden character. This is merely to
spoil the wood, which, in many cases, is already so good that any addition
would be a tasteless intrusion of something irrelevant and unsuitable. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Still, there are certain wooded places where a
judicious planting would be a gain, and there are a certain number of trees and
shrubs which those who have a fair knowledge of their ways, and a true sympathy
with the nature of woodland, recognise as suitable for this kind of planting.
They will be found in these classes: Native growths that are absent or unusual
in the district, such as the Spindle Tree (<span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Euonymus</span>),
White Beam, Service Tree, White and Black Thorn, Wild Cherry, Bird Cherry, Wild
Guelder Rose (<span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Viburnum Opulus</span>), and <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>V. Lantana</span>, Honeysuckle, Wild Roses,
Juniper, and <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Daphne Laureola</span>. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Then, among cultivated trees and shrubs, those
that are nearly related to our wild kinds, including some that are found in
foreign woodlands that have about the same latitude and climate as our own.
Among these will be Quinces and Medlars, many kinds of ornamental Cratægus,
Scarlet Oaks, various Elders and Crabs, and the grand <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Pyrus americana</span>, so like our native
Mountain Ash, but on a much larger scale.</span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>A very careful planting with trees and shrubs of
some of these and, perhaps, other allied kinds, may give additional beauty and
interest to woodland. Differences of soil will, of course, be carefully
considered, for if a piece of woodland were on chalky soil, a totally different
selection should be made from one that would be right for a soil that was poor
and sandy. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>In moist, sandy, or, still better, peaty ground,
especially where there is a growth of Birches and Scotch Firs, and not many
other kinds of trees, a plantation of Rhododendrons may have a fine effect. But
in this case it is better to use the common <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>R.
ponticum</span> only, as a mixture of differently coloured kinds is sure to
give a misplaced-garden look, or an impression as if a bit of garden ground had
missed its way and got lost in the wood.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Grouping of Trees and Shrubs</span></h1>

<p class=Body-first><span lang=EN-US>f this subject were considered with only a
reasonable amount of thought, and the practice of it controlled by good taste,
there is nothing that would do more for the beauty of our gardens or grounds.
Nothing can so effectually destroy good effect as the usual senseless mixture
of deciduous and evergreen shrubs that, alas! is so commonly seen in gardens—a
mixture of one each of a quantity of perhaps excellent things planted about
three feet apart. There would be nothing to be said against this if it were the
deliberate intention of any individual, for, as a garden is for the owner's
happiness, it is indisputably his right to take his pleasure in it as he will,
and if he says, &quot;I have only space for a hundred plants, and I wish them
to be all different,&quot; that is for him to decide. But when the mixture is
made from pure ignorance or helplessness it is then that advice may be of use,
and that the assurance may be given that there are better ways that are just as
easy at the beginning, and that with every year will be growing on towards some
definite scheme of beauty, instead of merely growing up into a foolish tangle
of horticultural imbecility. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>If the intending planter has no knowledge it is
well worth his while to take advice at the beginning, not to plant at random
and to feel, a few years later, first doubt, and then regret, and then, as
knowledge grows, to have to face the fact that it is all wrong and that much
precious time has been lost. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>How to group is a large question, depending on
all the conditions of the place under consideration. Whether a group is to be
of tall or short growing shrubs or trees, whether it is to be of three or three
hundred, and so on. The knowledge that can answer is the knowledge of gardening
of the better kind. The whole thing should be done carefully on paper
beforehand, or there will again be repented the error of huddled single plants.
The groups will have to be well shaped and well sized and well related to each
other and all that is near, or they may be merely a series of senseless blocks,
not intelligently formed groups at all. </span></p>

<p class=inlineimage><span lang=EN-US><img width=342 height=513 id="Picture 2"
src="ECGardens.fld/image002.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=Captions><span lang=EN-US>Single plants, such as the Forsythia
suspensa, look most striking when planted against dark, well-formed shrub
groupings.</span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Then, in proper relation to the groups, single
plants can be used with the best possible effect, as, for instance, a snowy
Mespilus or a Cherry or a <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Pyrus floribunda</span>
against a dark massing of Yew or Holly; or a <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Forsythia suspensa</span> casting out its long
flowering branches from among bushes of <span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Berberis</span>.
Then the fewer individuals will have their full value, while the larger masses
will have dignity even when in leaf only, and their own special beauty at the
time when they are in flower or fruit. For some flowering and fruiting bushes
are best grouped, while a few are best seen standing alone, and it is only
knowledge of good gardening that can guide the designer in his decisions on
these points. Still it does not follow that a shrub or flowering tree cannot be
used both for groups and single use, for such an one as the Forsythia just
mentioned is also of charming effect in its own groups, with the red-tinted <span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Berberis</span> or the quiet-coloured Savins, or
whatever be the lower growing bushy mass that is chosen to accompany it. Every
one can see the great gain of such arrangements when they are made, but to
learn to make them, and even to perceive what are the plants to group together,
and why, that is the outcome of the education of the garden artist. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>In the Royal Gardens, Kew, the best of plants
may be seen and, to a considerable degree, the best ways of using them in
gardens. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>The one-thing-at-a-time planting is always a
safe guide, but as the planter gains a firmer grasp of his subject, so he may
exercise more freedom in its application. Nearly every garden, shrubbery, and
ornamental tree plantation is spoilt or greatly marred by too great a mixture
of incongruous growths. Nothing wants more careful consideration. On the ground
in the open air, and sitting at home quietly thinking, the question should be
carefully thought out. The very worst thing to do is to take a nursery
catalogue and make out from it a list of supposed wants. The right thing is to
make a plan of the ground, to scale, if possible, though a rougher one may
serve, and mark it all down in good time beforehand, not to wait until the last
moment and then mark it; and not to send the list to the nursery till the
ground is well forward for planting, so that the moment the plants come they
may go to their places</span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>All this planning and thinking should be done in
the summer, so that the list may go to the nursery in September, which will
enable the nurseryman to supply the trees in the earliest and best of the
planting season. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>How good it would be to plant a whole hill-side
on chalky soil with grand groupings of Yew or Box, or with these intergrouped,
and how easy afterwards to run among these groupings of lesser shrubs; or to
plant light land with Scotch Fir and Holly, Thorn and Juniper (just these few
things grouped and intergrouped); or wastes of sandhills near the sea within
our milder shores with Sea Buckthorn and Tamarisk, and Monterey Cypress (<span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Cupressus macrocarpa</span>), and long drifts of
the handsome Blue Lyme Grass. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>A mile of sandy littoral might be transformed
with these few things, and no others than its own wild growths, into a region
of delight, where noble tree form of rapid growth, tender colour of plume-like branch
and bloom and brilliant berry, and waving blue grassy ribbons, equalling in
value any of the lesser Bamboos, would show a lesson of simple planting such as
is most to be desired but is rarely to be seen. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>The other and commoner way is nothing but a muddle
from beginning to end. A van-load of shrubs arrives from the nursery—one of
each or perhaps not more than six of any kind. No plan is prepared, and the
trees and shrubs are planted in the usual weary mixture, without thought or
design. Generally there are three times too many for the space. It is a cruel
waste and misuse of good things. </span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-US>Healthy Paths in Outer Garden Spaces</span></h1>

<p class=Body-first><span lang=EN-US>The subject of heathy paths comes within
the scope of this book. We are not thinking of grass or gravel paths, but those
in pleasure-grounds that are beyond the province of the trimly-kept garden, and
yet have to be somewhat tamed from the mere narrow track such as serves for the
gamekeeper on his rounds. Paths of this kind admit of varied treatment. The
nature of the place and the requirements of those who use the paths will
determine their general nature, and settle whether they are to be of turf or of
something that must be dry in all weathers. But grass and gravel are not the
only alternatives. One kind of path not often seen, but always pleasant, and at
one time of year distinctly beautiful, can be made of the Common Heather (<span
class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Calluna vulgaris</span>). We know of such a path,
12 feet wide and some hundreds of feet long, carpeted with this native Heath,
mown once a year, and feeling like a thick pile carpet to the feet; grey-green
in summer, bronze-coloured in late autumn, and in the second and third weeks of
August thickly set with short sprays of the low-toned pink of the Heather
bloom. It is not so dry as a gravel path, but a good deal drier than grass, and
has a pleasant feeling of elasticity that is absent in common turf. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Many are the pleasure-grounds in the south of
England and Scotland where the soil is sandy and, perhaps, peaty. Any such can
have these pleasant heathy paths. We have even seen them on a poor sandy clay,
scarcely good enough to call loam, in Sussex; for Calluna, unlike the other
Heaths, will grow willingly in clay. In the case quoted the plant was wild in
the place. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>In a Fir wood, the bare earth carpeted with needles
always makes a suitable path, and one that is always dry; the only thing to
correct is to fill up any places where the bare roots rise above the path
level. For in these informal paths, where we want to look about and at the
trees, there should be no danger of being tripped up. The path, of whatever
nature, should be wide enough for two persons—5 feet to 6 feet is ample; but it
should have quite a different character from the garden path, in that its edges
are not defined or straightened. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>One may often see in the outskirts of an old
garden a dense wood that once was only a growth of shrubbery size. The walk was
originally bordered by a Box edging, and there may have been a strip of flowers
between it and the shrubs. Here and there one may still see a yard or two of
straggling Box nearly 2 feet high. Of course, this edging should have been
removed as soon as the place became a wood, for after a certain time its
original use as a formal edging to a trim plantation ceased to exist. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Nothing is pleasanter in woodland than broad,
grassy ways, well enough levelled to insure safety to an unheeding walker. In
early spring, before the grass has grown any height, here is the place where
Daffodils can best be seen and enjoyed, some in the clear grass and some running
back in wide drifts into any side opening of the wood. If the grass is cut in
June, when the Daffodil foliage is ripe, and again early in September, these
two mowings will suffice for the year. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>In many woody places where shade is fairly
thick, if there is any grass it will probably be full of moss. No path-carpet
is more beautiful than a mossy one; indeed, where grass walks from the garden
pass into woodland, the mossy character so sympathetic to the wood should be
treasured, and the moss should not be scratched out with iron rakes. Often in
the lawn proper a mixture of moss and grass is desirable, though one has been
taught that all moss is hateful. In such places, though it may be well to check
it by raking out every four or five years, it should by no means be destroyed,
for in the lawn spaces adjoining trees or woodland the moss is right and
harmonious. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>There are paths for the garden and paths for the
wood. A mistaken zeal that would insist on the trimness of the straight-edged
garden walk in woodland or wild is just as much misplaced as if by slothful
oversight an accumulation of dead leaves or other débris of natural decay were
permitted to remain in the region of formal terrace or parterre. </span></p>

<p class=Body><span lang=EN-US>Heath paths should be made by either planting or
sowing. The common ling (<span class=GenusPlantNames-InCopy>Calluna vulgaris</span>)
makes the best turf. If the ground is sown it should be of nearly pure sandy
peat, or weeds would be troublesome. If the path is to be made by planting, it
should be done with two-year-old seedlings—nothing larger—planted about 6
inches apart. The path when grown should be mown with a machine once a year, in
autumn after the blooming time of the heath. There must be no grass.</span></p>
